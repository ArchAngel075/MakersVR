Instructions for building the Configurator test program

Since I can't and don't want to ship hundreds of megabytes binaries, you'll have to build two dependencies yourself
However for your and my own sanity I made it very straight forward (hopefully)

Requirements:
- A Windows 10 Machine
- MSVC compiler (either download Visual Studio, or download only the Build Tools like I did)
	https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
	This also ships with nmake, which is used for all builds
- For OpenCV build, CMake
	https://cmake.org/download/

1. Build OpenCV (see build/opencv/OpenCV_Build_Instructions.txt)
2. Build wxWidgets (see build/opencv/OpenCV_Build_Instructions.txt)
3. Build MakersVR Configurator
	In vcvars64 environment: "nmake -F build/Makefile.vc" (see .vscode/tasks.json)
	Or if you use vscode, just execute the build task
	Currently, only release works, seemingly due to some errors with the OpenCV build
