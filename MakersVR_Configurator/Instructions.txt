Instructions for building the Configurator test program

Since I can't and don't want to ship hundreds of megabytes binaries, you'll have to build two dependencies yourself
However for your and my own sanity I made it very straight forward (hopefully)

Requirements:
- A Windows 10 Machine
- MSVC compiler (either download Visual Studio, or download only the Build Tools like I did)
	https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
	This also ships with nmake, which is used for all builds
- For OpenCV build, CMake
	https://cmake.org/download/

1. Build OpenCV (see build/opencv/OpenCV_Build_Instructions.txt)
2. Build wxWidgets (see build/opencv/OpenCV_Build_Instructions.txt)
3. Build MakersVR Configurator
	In vcvars64 environment: "nmake -F build/Makefile.vc" (see .vscode/tasks.json)
	Or if you use vscode, just execute the build task

Notes on the build system:
Both build and debug configurations work fine, using the respective builds of the libraries.
However, the build system is not perfect, changing headers does NOT cause all the scripts relying on this header to recompile, which can result in odd behaviour as older objects read and write to memory which they should not. In that case, build/obj needs to be cleared to force a recompile.
