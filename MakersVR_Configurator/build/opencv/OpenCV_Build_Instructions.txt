OpenCV Build Instructions

These are instructions for a minimal OpenCV build (10-20min)
You can build OpenCV fully, but using the provided configuration only builds the required modules

This requires a windows machine
Make sure you have CMake for windows and MSVC installed (either with Visual Studio or using Visual Studio Build Tools)

Download the OpenCV source (either by cloning the git repo, or better downloading the source zip)
- No need to install any additional dependencies
- Version used: 4.3.0

Open the Developer Command Prompt of MSVC (x64 native)
- alternatively, execute vcvars64 in a normal Command Prompt (not Powershell)

Then enter this build folder and build:
	cd MakersVR_Configurator/build/opencv
	build.bat "Path/To/OpenCV_Source"

This will also automatically copy the files into the project directories
If everything succeeded, you can cleanup all build files (several hundred MB):
	clean.bat
The build is done within the current folder (build, install subdirectories), the OpenCV source directory is not touched
