wxWidgets Build Instructions

These are instructions for a minimal wxWidgets build (10-20min)
You can build wxWidgets fully, but using the provided configuration only builds the required modules

This requires a windows machine
Make sure you have MSVC installed (either with Visual Studio or using Visual Studio Build Tools)

Download the wxWidgets source (either by cloning the git repo, or better downloading the source zip)
- No need to install any additional dependencies
- Version used: 3.1.3

Open the Developer Command Prompt of MSVC (x64 native)
- alternatively, execute vcvars64 in a normal Command Prompt (not Powershell)

Then enter this build folder and build:
	cd MakersVR_Configurator/build/wxWidgets
	build.bat "Path/To/wxWidgets_Source"

This will also automatically copy the files into the project directories
If everything succeeded, you can cleanup all build files (several hundred MB):
	clean.bat "Path/To/wxWidgets_Source"
The build is done within the wxWidgets source folder itself, but cleanup should clear everything afaik
