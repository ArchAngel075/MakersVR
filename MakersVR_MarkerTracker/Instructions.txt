This is mainly general instructions for developing for the STM32F103, aka BluePill, for which there are a ton of separate tutorials.

Hardware Requirements:
- STM32F103 development board. Most likely the Blue Pill (around 2.5â‚¬), with headers soldered on
- A programmer. I use a simple FTDI programmer with 3.3V output (IMPORTANT!), but you could use on of those ST-Links as well if you need debugging

Software Requirements:
1. Get the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain, and make sure it's in the path
	https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm
	(I used 9-2019-q4-major, anything after that should work just fine)
2. Get the STM32CubeProgrammer, and make sure it's in the path
	https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html
3. Now you could either use VSCode (with everything set up already), or adapt what you can find in the .vscode/tasks.json folder. These are simple commands and should be self-explanatory.
	IMPORTANT: Change Com4 in the upload task to the COM-port your programmer shows up on 

Hardware:
- Make sure you have a Pinout of the STM32F103 handy
- Connect your programmer to TX1/RX1 ports on PA9 and PA10, as always RX-TX switched
- Then connect the 3.3V (!!) and GND pins
- Then make sure the Yellow Jumpers are in the programming position (look it up)
- Then plug your programmer in (Not the board itself)

Software:
- Test if you can build the project (in VCCode Ctrl-Shift-P, Run Task, Build)
- Figure out the COM port of your programmer and replace it in .vscode/tasks.json in port=COMx
- Test if you can upload the build (in VCCode Ctrl-Shift-P, Run Task, Upload)
- If everything works, cool

Once uploaded, you can change the Yellow Jumpers back to the working position, unplug the programmer and plug in your STM32F103. It should show up as "MakersVR Device" and should be able to connect in the Configurator.
To get the blobs to show up however, you need to build the rest of the hardware.
